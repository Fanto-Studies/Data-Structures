    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    - A Queue is like a line of people waiting for something — for example, at a bank, a coffee shop, or a bus stop.
    - In technology, a Queue is a way to organize tasks or items so that they are handled in the order they arrived. This is called First-In, First-Out (FIFO) — the first item that goes into the queue is the first one to come out.
    <h3>Real-life examples</h3>
    - Email sending system: Emails are added to a queue and sent one by one.
    - Print jobs: When you print multiple documents, they go into a queue and are printed in order.
    - Customer support: People waiting to talk to an agent are placed in a queue.
    - Online orders: Orders are processed in the order they were received.
