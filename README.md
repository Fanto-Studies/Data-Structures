    <summary> :green_book: Queue</summary>    
    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A Queue is like a line of people waiting for something — for example, at a bank, a coffee shop, or a bus stop.</p>
    <p>In technology, a Queue is a way to organize tasks or items so that they are handled in the order they arrived. This is called <b>First-In, First-Out (FIFO)</b> — the first item that goes into the queue is the first one to come out.</p>
    <h3>Real-life examples</h3>
    <p><b>Email sending system</b>: Emails are added to a queue and sent one by one.</p>
    <p><b>Print jobs</b>: When you print multiple documents, they go into a queue and are printed in order.</p>
    <p><b>Customer support</b>: People waiting to talk to an agent are placed in a queue.</p>
    <p><b>Online orders</b>: Orders are processed in the order they were received.</p>
